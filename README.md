SRH Sports Club Management - Online Sports Hall Booking.

SRH Campus Sports at the SRH Hochshule Heidelberg, has a fantastic Indoor Ground, Swimming Pool and Gymnasium to support students studying at the SRH to achieve their passion towards sports.

This project aims to implement the "Online Slot Booking" for a groups of students who want to practice any particular kind of Sport (Cricket, Football, BasketBall, Judo, Wrestling, Table Tennis, Badminton etc.,) for a particular amount of time. They have to make an advance booking before they are in the SRH Campus Sports. This should also solve the conflict between groups of students managing to play two or more different sport in one single place.
